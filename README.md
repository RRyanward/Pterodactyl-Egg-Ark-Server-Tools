# Pterodactyl-Egg-Ark-Server-Tools
This tool allows you to manage any ARK: Survival Evolved linux server without having to remember long commands. It provides a lot of features, to get the full list check the Usage section please check out the developers github at https://github.com/arkmanager/ark-server-tools. This runs on Pterodactyl with my custom egg file and docker it puts the docker into a /bin/bash environment as this tool has commands that we can't be locked to the container entrypoint.sh file.

Note: You may have to run the install twice to get the ARK folder to populate it's like steamcmd gets hung after download is complete running it again will verfiy then extract.

Thank you @klightspeed for your hardwork on this tool.
